Add a DinnerClub class. Each DinnerClub object represents a group of friends who go out to eat together frequently.

Dinner clubs should be able to list each member's name along with how much that person has paid during their def history  
endo f membership in the club. You will use the CheckSplitter class to calculate how much each member owes for each dinner
club event. Not every member goes to each event, so sometimes the check splitter is splitting a check between 4 people 
and sometimes it's 3 or 7 or 10 or you get the picture.
